# AI-Calculator-Computer-Vision
Developed an AI-powered calculator using Computer Vision and Generative AI for real-time mathematical problem-solving, allows users to have two modes: Air Draw and Trackpad Draw.

## Introduction
This project enables users to naturally draw mathematical expressions, captures them using real-time hand gesture recognition (OpenCV + MediaPipe) or a trackpad, and solves them using Google’s Generative AI. It provides step-by-step solutions, making it an efficient problem-solving tool, eliminating the need for traditional input methods.

## Key Technologies and Skills
- Python
- Google Gemini AI
- Computer Vision
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- Numpy
- Streamlit

## Objectives

Based on my analysis, I set the following objectives:

a. **Recognition** – Develop a real-time mathematical expression recognition system.  

b. **Gesture Tracking** – Implement computer vision techniques for hand gesture tracking.  

c. **Computation** – Integrate generative AI for accurate mathematical computation.  

d. **Interface** – Use Streamlit for designing a user-friendly interface.
